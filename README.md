# Applied Data Science Capstone

## Project Scenario and Overview

### Background
The dawn of the commercial space age has brought space travel to the forefront of technological advancements, making it more accessible than ever. Companies like Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, and Blue Origin are pushing the boundaries by providing suborbital flights, deploying small satellites, and developing reusable rockets. Among these innovators, SpaceX stands out with its significant achievements, which include:

- Regular shipments to the International Space Station.
- The development of Starlink, a satellite internet constellation.
- Successfully executing manned missions to space.

A critical element to SpaceX’s success is cost efficiency, notably through the reusable design of their Falcon 9 rockets. Priced at approximately 62 million dollars per launch, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 is substantially cheaper compared to its competitors, who charge upwards of 165 million dollars.

### Project Focus
In this capstone project, you will assume the role of a data scientist working for a nascent space venture, Space Y, poised to compete with industry giants. Founded by the visionary billionaire industrialist Allon Musk, Space Y aims to carve out its own niche in the burgeoning space market.

Your primary objective is to analyze and predict the costs associated with each launch by:

- Gathering and analyzing data related to SpaceX’s launch activities.
- Creating interactive dashboards that will provide your team with insightful analytics.
- Developing a machine learning model to predict whether the Falcon 9’s first stage will be reused in future launches.

### Importance of the First Stage
The Falcon 9 rocket operates with a two-stage mechanism:

- **First Stage**: Responsible for the initial thrust and trajectory towards space. This stage is the powerhouse of the rocket, and its successful recovery is vital for cost reduction.
- **Second Stage**: Primarily involved in payload delivery into orbit after the first stage has done its part.

Understanding the dynamics and operational success of the first stage is crucial because its reuse significantly reduces the overall launch cost. Throughout this project, you will explore factors that influence the likelihood of the first stage landing successfully, such as mission parameters and payload requirements.

### Methodology
By leveraging publicly available data on SpaceX launches, and using statistical and machine learning techniques, you will develop predictive models that can forecast first stage recoverability. This predictive capability will be instrumental for Space Y as it seeks to optimize launch costs and enhance operational efficiencies in its quest to become a formidable player in the space industry.
